 "next_steps_description" : "Growing and evolving has always been the most natural part of every individual. In today's fast-paced world, adapting is not just an optionâ€”itâ€™s a necessity. The future holds incredible opportunities, and with the powerful tools we have at our disposal, the only direction is forward. I am currently expanding my skills and expertise in front-end development, with a focus on incorporating cutting-edge technologies like Three.js, Blender, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The potential of 3D on the web is immense; it allows for unparalleled interaction, whether itâ€™s showcasing a product, exploring an environment, or visualizing assets like real estate. By integrating 3D elements, we can create more immersive and engaging experiences that give users greater control and insight. Additionally, by harnessing AI, I aim to push the boundaries even further, making these experiences not only visually compelling but also intelligent and responsive. This combination of front-end innovation and AI represents the future of web development, where dynamic, interactive, and personalized user experiences will become the standard.",

 "inventory_management_app_description" : "Web application made with React, JavaScript, HTML and pure (vanilla) CSS for the Front End. The Backend was made using MySQL and Express. This project is made entirely by my own. The application is basically a software prototype to control the stock and item flow in a gastronomy business. I was a chef before I started programming and one of the things I found more chaotic in restaurants and different gastronomic businesses is the lack of control and digitalization, specially here in Spain. The idea is to have the storage and item flow in real-time, so storage spaces are always used and stored in the same way. With two-way communication between workers and managers. The manager would be able to see all what's going on in the restaurant with a simple storage layout separated by colors and shapes representing the actual kitchen or restaurant space. The manager can filter all items by category, name or storage space, so with two easy steps he or she can have control of everything. At the same time, workers would be able to update the status of all items with their own application from phones or tablets, so everything would be flowing on real time. Paper is slow and people don't have time almost never to actually write on it, so most financial changes get lost due to the lack of time required to operate on it.",

Easier tasks give fewer diamonds, while harder or longer tasks give more diamonds. <br/><br/> <strong>Randomizer:</strong> The Randomizer section is where tasks are randomized each week. Users can use their diamonds to buy the tasks they prefer. Easier tasks cost more diamonds. Unbought tasks are randomly assigned to the remaining users. This way, users who did harder tasks one week can buy easier ones the next. <br/><br/> <strong>Home Needs:</strong> The Home Needs section highlights the most urgent tasks. Tasks that are neglected for longer periods offer more diamonds and appear in red to indicate urgency. <br/><br/> <strong>Character Customization:</strong> Users can unlock character items to customize their avatar. The more tasks a user completes, the more customization options they unlock. <br/><br/> <strong>Calendar Integration:</strong> Users can add tasks to the calendar, which are then added to the general task list. This helps keep everyone on track and aware of upcoming tasks. <br/><br/> The Roomie App transforms household chores into a fun and rewarding game, encouraging users to complete tasks and maintain a clean and organized home.
