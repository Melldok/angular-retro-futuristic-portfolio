  "printing_tool_description": "A specialized application designed to streamline the testing and labeling process for newly manufactured devices. Collaborating closely with the backend team, who handled the testing in Python, we created a seamless solution to ensure the functionality and quality of each device. Key Features: Device Testing: The application conducts comprehensive tests on new devices to verify that all sensors operate correctly under specified parameters. This ensures that each device meets the required standards before proceeding to the next steps. Barcode and ID Generation: Once a device passes the testing phase, the application generates a unique barcode and ID for it. This information is crucial for tracking and managing the devices within the logistics platform. Printing Integration: The application communicates directly with a physical printer to send the generated barcode and ID, ensuring accurate and efficient label printing. This step was meticulously tested with the printer in hand to ensure correct communication, label sizes, and layouts. Unified Process: Unlike using separate subscription-based applications for different stages, we integrated the entire process of testing and printing into a single application. This integration enhances efficiency, reduces potential errors, and provides a smoother workflow. Overall, the Printing Tool is a robust and efficient application that ensures the quality and traceability of newly manufactured devices, integrating testing and printing processes into a unified system.",
  "inventory_management_app" : "Inventory Management App",
  "inventory_management_app_description" : "Web application made with React, JavaScript, HTML and pure (vanilla) CSS for the Front End. The Backend was made using MySQL and Express. This project is made entirely by my own. The application is basically a software prototype to control the stock and item flow in a gastronomy business. I was a chef before I started programming and one of the things I found more chaotic in restaurants and different gastronomic businesses is the lack of control and digitalization, specially here in Spain. The idea is to have the storage and item flow in real-time, so storage spaces are always used and stored in the same way. With two-way communication between workers and managers. The manager would be able to see all what's going on in the restaurant with a simple storage layout separated by colors and shapes representing the actual kitchen or restaurant space. The manager can filter all items by category, name or storage space, so with two easy steps he or she can have control of everything. At the same time, workers would be able to update the status of all items with their own application from phones or tablets, so everything would be flowing on real time. Paper is slow and people don't have time almost never to actually write on it, so most financial changes get lost due to the lack of time required to operate on it.",

  "roomie_app_description": "I developed the Roomie App to make household tasks more manageable and fun. The app gamifies chores by assigning diamond values to tasks based on their difficulty and duration.   Key Features:  Task Assignment: Each week, the home has several recurring tasks to complete. Easier tasks give fewer diamonds, while harder or longer tasks give more diamonds.   Randomizer: The Randomizer section is where tasks are randomized each week. Users can use their diamonds to buy the tasks they prefer. Easier tasks cost more diamonds. Unbought tasks are randomly assigned to the remaining users. This way, users who did harder tasks one week can buy easier ones the next.   Home Needs: The Home Needs section highlights the most urgent tasks. Tasks that are neglected for longer periods offer more diamonds and appear in red to indicate urgency.   Character Customization: Users can unlock character items to customize their avatar. The more tasks a user completes, the more customization options they unlock.   Calendar Integration: Users can add tasks to the calendar, which are then added to the general task list. This helps keep everyone on track and aware of upcoming tasks.   The Roomie App transforms household chores into a fun and rewarding game, encouraging users to complete tasks and maintain a clean and organized home. The screenshots illustrate the app's gamified approach and intuitive design.",
